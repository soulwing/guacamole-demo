cas-basic
=========

This configuration shows a basic CAS authentication configuration with
a static `user-mapping.xml` for authorization. Before using this 
configuration download the CAS extension from 
[Guacamole Downloads](https://guacamole.apache.org/releases/), unpack
the distribution archive, and drop the `.jar` file it contains into a
subdirectory of this directory named `extensions/`.
